tuesday night design of model
=============================

it's one big model, but when we do local inference ("infer"/"decide"), we are fixing group-level parameters

suppose that we track two things:
- mood (continuous variable between 0 and 1)
- discrete variable (task)

imagine a discrete time process.
mood and task are random walks.
- rate of change of mood (variance of a 0-mean gaussian)
- rate of switching task (probability of switching tasks [changing tasks is a uniform draw])

(goal of this design is just to have a dumb model that we can verify actually is sensitive to adding data)

q: what does the data look like?
- we have two types of questions (mood, task).
- mood response = datetime + mood, task response = datetime + task multiple choice.
